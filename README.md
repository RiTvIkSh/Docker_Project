# Docker_Project
docker project :-

In context to the project we have to build for docker , i tried to built a system by using docker images and containers system to load certain O.S to built a client-server system for developing website.

primarily i used wordpress:5.1.1php7.3-apache along with mysql:5.7 for handling and managing my database.

this all was done by loading images in docker and using docker container system for faster work and execution.

also uploaded some images related to codes , containers , images used in the project.

thank you for your consideration.
